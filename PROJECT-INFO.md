# WaveBase — Project Information & Session Guide

---

## 1. Session Protocol — MUST READ FIRST

### For the AI agent:
You **must** update this file at the end of every session. After completing any feature, fix, or significant change:

1. Update the status indicators (✅ ⬜ ⚠️) in Architecture and Feature Roadmap sections
2. Add a new entry to the Session Log with what was accomplished
3. Update Session Priority to reflect what should be worked on next
4. Add any new known issues or decisions to the appropriate sections
5. Always leave the file in a state that accurately reflects the project

### For the human:
Start every new session by saying:

> **"Follow the instructions in PROJECT-INFO.md"**

This tells the AI to read this file first to understand the project's current state and what to work on next.

## 2. Project Overview

**WaveBase** is a fast, lightweight audio library manager for music producers.

Music producers have thousands of audio files spread across their hard drives — loops, one-shots, stems, project exports, sample packs. WaveBase lets them point the app at one or more directories, scans and indexes all audio files, and presents everything in a clean, fast, well-organised interface. Producers can tag, search, preview and manage their entire library without ever leaving the app.

### Data Flow

```
User clicks "Scan Directory"
  → @tauri-apps/plugin-dialog opens native folder picker
  → invoke('scan_directory', { path }) to Rust backend
  → walkdir scans for audio files
  → Files inserted into SQLite audio_files table
  → Vec<ScannedFile> returned to frontend
  → Frontend maps to Track[] and renders in TrackList
        ↓
User clicks a track
  → Frontend selects it, PlayerBar updates
  → TODO: invoke('play_audio', { path }) to Rust backend
  → TODO: Rodio plays audio
  → TODO: Real waveform data from decoded audio samples
        ↓
User types in search box
  → TODO: Debounced invoke('search_files', { query })
  → TODO: SQLite query with proper indexing
  → TODO: Results rendered in TrackList
```

### Database Schema

```sql
audio_files (
  id          INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  path        TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  filename    TEXT NOT NULL,
  folder_path TEXT NOT NULL,

## 5. Current State (Session 8)

### ✅ Working / Stable
- App launches, shows full UI
- "Scan Directory" picks a folder, scans for audio files, returns results
- Files inserted into SQLite `audio_files` table
- UI renders: Titlebar, Toolbar with filters, TrackList with mock data, PlayerBar with waveform canvas
- Selection state, stem expansion work
- Database connection pool, migrations, schema all set up
- Custom dark theme CSS complete (no Tailwind utility classes used yet)
- Clean app data dir management (%APPDATA%/wavebase, ~/Library/Application Support/wavebase)
- **Real audio playback via Rodio** — play, pause, resume, stop, volume control all working
- **Playback position & duration tracking** — position counter, playhead, and progress fill all update in real time
- **Track `path` field** — added to Track interface, used for playback targeting
- **Next/prev track navigation** — prev restarts track first click, then goes to previous; next wraps around
- **Smart prev button** — first click restarts current track, second click goes to previous
- **Real waveform from audio data** — waveform peaks extracted via Symphonia on the Rust backend, replaces synthetic sine waves
- **DB-stored track duration** — real duration saved to `audio_files.duration_secs` when waveform decode completes; used on subsequent plays for instant accurate progress
- **Click-to-seek** — click on progress bar or waveform canvas to seek to any position; uses pre-decoded PCM buffer for instant O(1) seeking
- **Keyboard shortcuts** — Space/MediaPlayPause toggles play/pause, MediaNextTrack/MediaPreviousTrack and Ctrl+Arrow for track navigation; suppressed when typing in input fields

### ⚠️ Partial / Needs Wiring
| Component | Issue | Details |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| `App.tsx` → TrackList | Uses mock data | Scanned files are returned but frontend doesn't query DB — maps `invoke<ScannedFile[]>` response directly to `Track[]`, doesn't use `list_files` |
| `lib/ui-logic.ts` | Stubs not wired | Playback, search, scan, library, tags state factories exist but aren't connected to Tauri commands |
| `Toolbar.tsx` | Visual only | Filter pills and search input render but don't do anything |

### ⬜ Not Yet Implemented (Stubs)
| Module | Files | What's Missing |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| **Filename parser** | `analysis/parser.rs` | Extract BPM, key, artist from filename patterns |
| **Audio analysis** | `analysis/decoder.rs`, `analysis/dsp.rs` | Symphonia decoding + stratum-dsp BPM/key detection |
| **Library commands** | `commands/library.rs` | search_files, get_file, list_file |
| **Tag commands** | `commands/tags.rs` | add_tag, remove_tag, list_tags |
| **File watcher** | `scanner/watcher.rs` | Real-time filesystem monitoring |
| **Bundle detection** | Not started | Group related files by folder |
| **Settings** | `config.rs` has path | No TOML read/write yet |

## 7. Implementation Details & Decisions

### Data Directory
- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\wavebase`
- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/wavebase`
- **Linux:** `~/.local/share/wavebase`
- Database: `wavebase.db`
- Settings: `settings.toml` (human-readable TOML)
- No files may be written anywhere else on the system.

### CSS Architecture
- Uses CSS custom properties (variables) for theming: `--bg`, `--surface`, `--text`, etc.
- Dark theme is default and only theme implemented
- No Tailwind utility classes used in component files — all styling via `index.css` class names
- DAW-inspired design: dark backgrounds, monospace for BPM/key, colored dots for file type
- Grid layout for track rows: `32px 28px 1fr 72px 96px 1fr` (drag-handle, dot, name, bpm, key, artists)

### Audio Formats Supported
`wav`, `mp3`, `aiff`, `aif`, `flac`, `ogg`, `m4a`, `wma`

### Database Conventions
- Connection pool: r2d2 with max 4 connections
- `INSERT OR IGNORE` for file insertion (path is UNIQUE)
- Proper indexes on frequently queried columns
- `ON DELETE CASCADE` on file_tags
- Timestamps as ISO 8601 strings via SQLite `datetime('now')`

### Naming Conventions
- Rust: snake_case for functions/variables, CamelCase for types
- TypeScript: camelCase for functions/variables, PascalCase for types/components
- CSS: kebab-case for class names
- Tables: snake_case (audio_files, file_tags, scan_roots)
- Directories: lowercase (src/components, src/lib, src-tauri/src/db)

### Git Branch Strategy
- `main` — stable, merged branches
- Feature branches: `Directory-Scanning`, `Simple-interface-skeleton`, etc.
- PRs merged into main

## 9. Session Log

### Session 1 — Initial Scaffolding
- Entire project structure scaffolded (Tauri 2 + React + Vite + SQLite + all crates)
- Database schema, models, migrations, pool set up
- All module stubs created (commands, scanner, playback, analysis)
- Backend compiles, app runs with "WaveBase" text

### Session 2 — UI Skeleton + Directory Scanning
- Full UI built: Titlebar, Toolbar, TrackList, PlayerBar
- Custom dark theme CSS (DAW-like design)
- Waveform canvas with synthetic data, play/pause/seek animation
- `ui-logic.ts` with utility functions and state stubs
- Directory scanning wired (native folder picker + walkdir scan)
- Files inserted into SQLite on scan
- Stem expansion UI, selection state, drag handles
- NOTES.md created with known issues and next priorities
- `PROJECT-INFO.md` created as the new master guide (NOTES.md removed)

### Session 3 — Real Audio Playback (Rodio)
- `playback/player.rs` completely rewritten: `AudioPlayer` wraps Rodio `OutputStream` + `Sink`
- Position tracking with pause-aware logic (accounts for cumulative pause duration)
- 7 Tauri commands: `play_audio`, `toggle_playback`, `pause_audio`, `resume_audio`, `stop_audio`, `get_playback_status`, `set_volume`
- `AudioPlayer` managed as Tauri state, initialized during `setup`
- Frontend `PlayerBar.tsx` rewired: removed synthetic RAF loop, added polling via `get_playback_status` every 200ms
- Play/pause/stop buttons call real Tauri commands
- Volume slider wired to `set_volume` command
- `Track` interface gained `path` field for playback targeting
- `App.tsx` maps `path` from scanned files

### Session 4 — Playback Position Fix + Nav Controls
- Added next/prev track navigation buttons with wrap-around
- Smart prev button: first click restarts current track, second click goes to previous track
- Fixed position not updating bug: `pos.max(0.0).min(0.0)` was clamping position to zero when `source.total_duration()` returns `None` (common for MP3). Changed to `min(if duration > 0.0 { duration } else { f64::MAX })`
- Fixed frontend time counter to omit ` / 0:00` when duration is unknown
- Removed debug overlay after confirming position tracking works
- **Fixed playhead not moving** — added Symphonia probe fallback (`probe_duration`) in `player.rs:140` to determine audio file duration when Rodio's `total_duration()` returns `None`
- Added frontend safety net (`maxPositionRef`) for the edge case where even Symphonia probing fails

### Session 8 — Global Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Added global keydown handler** in `App.tsx` — listens for `Space`, `MediaPlayPause`, `MediaNextTrack`, `MediaPreviousTrack`, and `Ctrl+ArrowLeft`/`Ctrl+ArrowRight`
- **Space / MediaPlayPause** → toggles play/pause on the currently selected track via `toggle_playback`
- **MediaNextTrack / Ctrl+ArrowRight** → skips to next track (wraps around)
- **MediaPreviousTrack / Ctrl+ArrowLeft** → skips to previous track (wraps around)
- **Input-aware** — shortcuts are suppressed when focus is in an `<input>` or `<textarea>` (e.g., search box)
- **Extracted `handleTogglePlay`** into `App.tsx` as a reusable callback, shared by the keyboard handler

### Session 7 — Click-to-Seek on Progress Bar & Waveform
- **Added `Command::Seek` to audio thread** — recreates the Rodio sink at an arbitrary position (rewritten mid-session for performance)
- **Added `seek_offset` tracking** — `flush_state()` now accepts `seek_offset: f64` so position = `seek_offset + elapsed_since_seek - total_paused`. Resets timing variables correctly on seek
- **Added `AudioPlayer::seek()` method** and `seek_audio` Tauri command — returns the updated `PlaybackStatus` after seeking
- **Frontend click handlers** on both `.progress-track` (always visible) and `#waveform-canvas` — computes click fraction × `status.duration`, invokes `seek_audio`, updates visual state immediately via both `setStatus(s)` and `updateVisuals(s)`
- **Edge cases handled:** seek while paused (stays paused at new position), seek to position beyond duration (clamped), seek when no track loaded (no-op)
- **First iteration (slow):** Used Rodio's `source.skip_duration(position)` — decodes every sample from start to seek position before playback can resume (~2s delay for MP3)
- **Second iteration (instant):** Replaced with PCM pre-decode approach. After each Play/Toggle, a background thread decodes the entire file to raw PCM (Vec<f32>) via Symphonia. On seek, a `SamplesBuffer` is created from the PCM data starting at the seek position — O(1) seek, no decoding at seek time. The background decode runs in parallel with Rodio playback, so by the time the user seeks, the buffer is usually ready. Falls back to the old slow path if the buffer isn't ready yet (edge case for immediate seeks on newly played files)

### Session 6 — Accurate Duration from File Headers (No Guessing)
- **Replaced file-size estimate with real header-based duration probe** — Added `lofty` crate to Cargo.toml, created `probe_duration()` in `player.rs` that reads actual audio file metadata headers (instant, no decode)
- **Removed `estimate_duration()`** — the 192 kbps file-size guess is gone. All formats now get accurate duration from their headers:
  - WAV: RIFF header → data_size / byte_rate
  - FLAC: STREAMINFO → total_samples / sample_rate
  - MP3: Xing/Info VBR header → frame_count × samples_per_frame / sample_rate
  - AIFF: COMM chunk → num_sample_frames / sample_rate
  - OGG/M4A: container-level metadata
- **Kept DB-stored duration as cache layer** — `store_track_duration` and the DB lookup in `play_audio`/`toggle_playback` remain as a fallback/optimization if `lofty` can't read a format. Waveform decode (Symphonia) still stores the most authoritative duration in the DB
- **Result:** Every play of every file has accurate progress from second one. No guessing, no jumping, no DB dependency for correctness
- **Stored real duration in DB after waveform decode** — Added `set_stored_duration()` helper in `commands/playback.rs` that writes to `audio_files.duration_secs`
- **Read stored duration from DB before playback** — `play_audio` and `toggle_playback` now query the DB for a stored duration before falling back to file-size estimate. If found, `player.set_duration()` immediately corrects the backend state
- **Added `store_track_duration` Tauri command** — called from the frontend's waveform `.then()` handler alongside the existing `set_duration` invoke
- **Result:** Second play of any MP3 file shows accurate progress from second one. No more guessing

### Session 5 — Real Waveform from Audio Data
- Created `playback/waveform.rs` — `compute_waveform_peaks()` uses Symphonia to decode audio and extract peak amplitude per time window
- `WaveformData` struct returns both `peaks: Vec<f64>` and `duration: f64` (computed from `codec_params.time_base` + `n_frames`)
- Added `get_waveform_data` Tauri command returning `WaveformData`
- Updated `PlayerBar.tsx` to call `get_waveform_data` only when playback starts (not on track selection), cache result in `waveRef`
- Duration from waveform decode updates frontend `status.duration` once available (replaces 0:00 for MP3 files)
- **Fixed 5-second playback delay** — removed Symphonia `probe_duration` from Play/Toggle commands (reverted to `unwrap_or(0.0)`). Symphonia's MP3 format reader was scanning the entire file to build a seek index, blocking playback start
- Added `resampleArray()` to `ui-logic.ts`, updated `drawWaveformToCanvas` to resample instead of regenerating synthetic data
- Deferred waveform loading to after playback starts
- Added waveform show/hide toggle button (waveform icon in transport bar)
- Moved progress-track/fill outside waveform-panel to always be visible at bottom of player
- Removed fixed 148px height from `.bottom` — auto-sizes to content (transport bar + waveform panel + progress bar)
- Changed `.waveform-panel` to fixed 108px height; when hidden, `.bottom` shrinks to just transport bar + progress bar
- **Fixed app freeze during waveform loading** — made `get_waveform_data` async with `tokio::task::spawn_blocking`. Previously it blocked a tokio worker thread, starving playback status polling and other IPC. Now runs on tokio's dedicated blocking thread pool (512 max threads)
- **Fixed stale waveform on track switch** — `waveRef.current` cleared immediately in waveform-loading effect before invoking backend
- **Replaced synthetic sine placeholder with flat dotted line** — while waveform is loading, canvas shows `Array(200).fill(0.02)` (tiny bars) instead of fake sine waves

## 10. Session Priority (Next Session)

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Tags and Filters** — Implement tag CRUD commands (add/remove/list tags per file), wire them to the frontend, and make the filter pills in Toolbar functional
2. **Wire TrackList to real database** — Create `list_files` and `get_file` Tauri commands, update `App.tsx` to call them on mount and after scan
3. **Implement filename parser** (`analysis/parser.rs`) — Extract BPM, key, artist from filenames during scanning

### Medium Priority
4. Implement audio analysis fallback (Symphonia + stratum-dsp for BPM/key)
5. Add click-to-seek on waveform (Rodio Sink doesn't support seeking — would need source recreation at target position)

### Lower Priority (but needed)
7. Tag CRUD commands
8. Bundle detection
9. File watcher
10. Settings persistence
11. Clean install/uninstall configuration

---

## 11. Known Issues & Gotchas

- **Mock data not from DB:** TrackList populates with mock/mapped scan results, never reads from `list_files` command
- **Synthetic waveform:** `ui-logic.ts` generates fake waveform data using combined sine waves — not real audio samples
- **Hardcoded duration:** PlayerBar uses static `154` seconds for all tracks
- **`chrono_from_system_time` in filesystem.rs:** Custom ISO 8601 formatting is fragile (doesn't account for leap years, doesn't use chrono crate) — consider replacing with proper chrono or time crate
- **No `noUnusedLocals` exemption:** tsconfig has strict unused locals/params checks — currently some stubs trigger warnings (the existing code may not compile under tsc --noEmit cleanly)
- **Scan is synchronous:** `scan_directory` blocks the UI thread for large directories — needs tokio + progress channel
- ~~**Duration unknown for MP3 files:** Fixed. `lofty` reads accurate duration from file headers for all formats — no more guessing or 5s wait~~
- **No click-to-seek on waveform:** Rodio Sink doesn't support seeking. Would need to recreate the Sink from a source started at the target position
- **Waveform decoding is synchronous and slow (~5s for MP3):** `get_waveform_data` decodes entire files on a background thread (`tokio::task::spawn_blocking`). Doesn't block IPC or polling. Flat dotted line shown as placeholder while decoding
- **Holding Ctrl+Arrow fires rapid track switching:** Keyboard handler has no debounce/throttle. Holding Ctrl+Arrow rapidly cycles through tracks, each firing play_audio + PCM decode. Lags briefly as decode threads queue up. Acceptable for normal use; holding the keys is an edge case
- **Tailwind not used in components:** All styling is via `index.css` classes, no Tailwind utility classes in JSX
- **Duplicate `analysis` and `db/models.rs` `ParsedMetadata`:** Both define similar metadata types — keep `db::models::ParsedMetadata` as the canonical type, use it from `analysis/parser.rs`
- **Edit the `analysis/parser.rs` test:** The placeholder test `test_parse_bpm` asserts `None` — update it once the parser is implemented
